# FlightDelayAnalysis-AA
## Departure Delay Analysis of domestic American Airline Flights departing Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) in 2023

INTRODUCTION: This Analysis will help you determine times and states/ airports with a high departure delay and their cause. Using this information, you can plan accordingly for your next travel and will be better prepared for departure delays. 

DATA/ OPERATIONS ABSTRACTION DESIGN: The data used is downloaded from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The orginial dataset contains many variables which haven't been used in this analysis and which are hidden in the tableau workbook. Some new variables have been created using existing variables and some data types of variables had to be adjusted for the analysis in tableau. This dataset contained very few missing values which made the preparation of the data very easy. 

FUTURE WORK: At this point, no future work is planned. But potential future work could inlcude looking at differnt years to verify trends that have been discovered in the 2023 dataset, as well as looking at different airlines or aiports. To complete the Flight Delay Analysis, arrival delay should be analyzed.
